PROBLEMS:
1 - My client.py connected to the server but instead receiving the correct response from the server
	it received "404 Not Found".
	The message I sent with the GET request was incorrect, and the server wasn't getting the filename, 
	therefore, the server couldn't read from the file and an exception occurred.
	
	
2 - Then, my client ONLY received "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".
	My server had an issue with iterating over the loop that sends the client the actual GET response wanted from the client(HTML body)
	My fix for this was creating a "while: True" loop that infinitely iterates and receives messages from the server until no more data is sent from the server.
	It seems as though the connection was closed as soon as "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" was received, and that was not the end of data needed to be sent.

3 - When concatenating the string received from the server in the "while True" loop and decoding I was given an type error.
	Both variables needed to be in "bytes" instead of string
	My fix for this was to make the response variable a bytes type:  response = b""
	
4 - I didn't know how to add input commands to the command that starts the client script,
	i.e. the "server_host server_port filename" part of "client.py server_host server_port filename"
	My solution was to import sys, and assign these 3 to individual variables using the "sys.argv" method
